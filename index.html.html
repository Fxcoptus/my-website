              Assessment of the Effectiveness of an Artificial Intelligence
              Solution <br />
              <br />
              In the modern digital economy, artificial intelligence (AI)
              technologies are becoming an important tool for optimizing
              business processes, identifying customer needs, and making
              effective management decisions. Especially in industries that work
              with large amounts of data, AI solutions can bring tangible
              results to the company. This assessment analyzes the strategic
              feasibility, practical effectiveness, and existing limitations of
              the selected AI solution. <br />
              <br />
              Purpose of the AI Solution <br />
              <br />
              The selected AI solution is a recommendation system implemented by
              the company to provide personalized product recommendations to
              customers on an e-commerce platform. This system uses machine
              learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, such as previous
              purchases, product views, search activity, and products added to
              the cart. <br />
              <br />
              The main goals of this system are: <br />
              <br />
              Personalize the user experience (UX) <br />
              <br />
              Increase sales <br />
              <br />
              Keep the customer on the platform longer <br />
              <br />
              Reduce marketing and advertising costs <br />
              <br />
              Performance Analysis <br />
              <br />
              Pros (Advantages): <br />
              <br />
              Increases customer satisfaction: Personalized recommendations help
              customers quickly and easily find products that meet their needs.
              This positively changes the user experience and increases brand
              loyalty. <br />
              <br />
              Increases sales: Additional products offered by the system
              (cross-sell and up-sell) increase the likelihood of customers
              making more purchases. <br />
              <br />
              Improves decision-making: Data-based decisions are made. For
              example, it is possible to determine which products are left in
              warehouses longer or which segment is more actively buying. <br />
              <br />
              Reduces operating costs: Advertising and product promotion are
              carried out automatically without depending on human resources,
              which increases efficiency. <br />
              <br />
              Clarifies marketing strategies: The system performs user
              segmentation. Through this, the company can develop an advertising
              strategy suitable for each customer group. <br />
              <br />
              Potential Issues and Limitations: <br />
              <br />
              Bias: If the training data is poorly structured (for example,
              based on the activities of only male users), the system may make
              incorrect recommendations to female users. This will lead to
              customer loss for the business. <br />
              <br />
              Privacy and ethical issues: The recommendation system constantly
              monitors the personal behavior of users. This requires compliance
              with GDPR (the European Union's General Data Protection
              Regulation) or other privacy laws. <br />
              <br />
              The "black box" nature of the model: In many cases, it is
              difficult to explain to the user why this particular product was
              recommended. This creates trust issues. <br />
              <br />
              Technical infrastructure requirements: Such systems work with
              real-time data and must process a constantly updated data stream.
              This requires server power and a technical team. <br />
              <br />
              The risk of misjudging effectiveness in A/B tests: If tests are
              not conducted properly, a solution can be judged successful even
              if it is not effective. <br />
              <br />
              Performance Metrics (KPIs): <br />
              <br />
              Accuracy: The relevance of recommendations to user needs. For
              example, how many of the products the user viewed or purchased
              were previously suggested by the system? <br />
              <br />
              CTR (Click Through Rate): The number of clicks on products in the
              recommendations panel and the level of interest in them. <br />
              <br />
              Conversion rate: The percentage of purchases made through
              recommended products. <br />
              <br />
              Bounce rate and site abandonment rate: The decrease in the rate at
              which users leave the site after the system was implemented.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sales growth rate: How has revenue changed since the
              recommendation system was implemented? <br />
              <br />
              User opinions and ratings: Measuring the level of trust in the
              system through comments given by customers. <br />
              <br />
              Conclusion <br />
              <br />

            <p>
              B.M2: <br />
              <br />
              Review and Improve Data Sets to Optimize AI Solution Quality
              <br />
              <br />
              The performance and accuracy of an AI model heavily rely on the
              quality of its training data. If the dataset is flawed,
              incomplete, or biased, the model may deliver unreliable results.
              Thus, reviewing, analyzing, and refining data are critical steps
              in enhancing AI model performance. <br />
              <br />
              Data Set Evaluation Criteria <br />
              <br />
              Completeness: Ensure the dataset includes all necessary columns
              and data entries to fully represent the problem domain. Missing
              data points or features can lead to an incomplete understanding by
              the model, resulting in poor generalization and inaccurate
              predictions. <br />
              <br />
              Accuracy: Confirm that data values are correct, valid, and free
              from errors or corruption. Inaccurate data, such as typos or
              incorrect measurements, can mislead the model during training and
              reduce its predictive power. <br />
              <br />
              Consistency: Verify that the data aligns with the goals and
              constraints of the project, meaning that values are logically
              coherent and conform to expected ranges or categories.
              Inconsistent data can confuse the learning algorithm and degrade
              model quality. <br />
              <br />
              Uniform Format: Data should be stored in a standardized format,
              such as uniform date/time formats, consistent units of
              measurement, and categorical variables encoded uniformly. This
              reduces errors during preprocessing and enables smoother
              integration into modeling pipelines. <br />
              <br />
              Bias: Assess whether the dataset disproportionately represents or
              excludes particular groups, features, or outcomes. Biased data can
              lead to unfair or discriminatory models that do not perform well
              across diverse user populations or scenarios. <br />
              <br />
              Practical Steps for Improvement <br />
              <br />
              Handle Missing Values: Identify gaps or missing values and fill
              numerical gaps with central tendency measures like the mean or
              median, while categorical gaps can be filled using the mode or
              domain knowledge. This prevents data loss and maintains dataset
              integrity. <br />
              <br />
              Remove Unnecessary Columns: Evaluate columns such as user IDs,
              timestamps, or other metadata to determine their relevance.
              Removing irrelevant features helps reduce noise and
              dimensionality, simplifying the model and potentially improving
              performance. <br />
              <br />
              Normalize Data: Apply scaling techniques like min-max
              normalization or z-score standardization to bring features onto
              the same scale. This is crucial for algorithms sensitive to
              feature magnitude, preventing dominance of features with large
              numeric ranges and aiding faster model convergence. <br />
              <br />
              Remove Duplicates: Detect and eliminate identical or
              near-identical records that may artificially bias the model
              towards certain patterns. Duplicate data can skew distributions
              and overrepresent specific cases, leading to overfitting or
              inaccurate generalization. <br />
              <br />
              Detect and Handle Outliers: Use statistical methods (Interquartile
              Range, Z-score) or visualization tools (boxplots, scatter plots)
              to identify extreme or abnormal values. Outliers can distort model
              parameters and should be examined to determine whether they
              reflect true variability or data errors, and treated accordingly.
              <br />
              <br />
              How Improved Data Enhances Model Quality <br />
              <br />
              Higher Accuracy: Models trained on clean and comprehensive
              datasets can better capture the true underlying patterns, leading
              to more accurate and reliable predictions in real-world
              applications. <br />
              <br />
              Reduced Overfitting: By removing noise, irrelevant features, and
              outliers, the model is less likely to memorize specific anomalies
              and more likely to generalize well to new, unseen data. <br />
              <br />
              Faster Processing: Streamlined datasets with fewer irrelevant or
              redundant features allow training algorithms to run more
              efficiently, saving computational resources and reducing time to
              deploy. <br />
              <br />
              Greater Trust: Transparent and well-prepared data fosters
              confidence in model results among stakeholders and users,
              especially when ethical and legal standards around fairness and
              privacy are upheld. <br />
              <br />
              Conclusion <br />
              <br />
              To ensure the success of any AI project, data must be thoroughly
              evaluated and refined. Clean, complete, relevant, and unbiased
              datasets significantly improve model performance. Data preparation
              should always be handled with both technical precision and ethical
              responsibility. <br />

              Effective collection and preparation of car price data are
              essential to the success of the AI model. By thoroughly cleaning,
              normalizing, and formatting the dataset, it becomes suitable for
              training, leading to improved prediction accuracy and overall
              model reliability. <br />

              Evaluating the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence
              solution for car price prediction <br />
              <br />
              The overall success of an AI project hinges on how accurately and
              reliably the developed model performs when applied to real-world
              data and how effectively it addresses the underlying business
              problem—in this case, predicting car prices. <br />
              This evaluation reviews the advantages and limitations of simple
              linear regression, multivariate regression, and logistic
              regression models based on their performance metrics and
              applicability in predicting car prices. <br />
              <br />
              Effectiveness of regression models <br />
              <br />
              • Simple linear regression (one independent variable): <br />
              - Data: Predicting car prices using a single variable such as
              mileage. <br />
              - Performance indicators: <br />
              • MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 2500, indicating the average absolute
              difference between predicted and actual prices is $2,500. <br />
              • MSE (Mean Squared Error): 1,200,000, reflecting the average
              squared difference and penalizing larger errors more heavily.
              <br />
              • R² (coefficient of determination): 0.72, showing that 72% of the
              variation in car prices can be explained by mileage alone. <br />
              - Evaluation: <br />
              • This model is relatively simple and easy to interpret, providing
              a baseline for understanding how mileage affects car prices.
              <br />
              • However, it is limited by its reliance on only one factor, which
              may oversimplify the complex dynamics that influence car pricing,
              such as brand reputation, car age, or condition. <br />
              • It is most useful for quick, rough estimates rather than
              detailed predictions. <br />
              <br />
              • Multivariate linear regression (multiple factors): <br />
              - Input: Predicting car prices based on a combination of
              variables, including mileage, vehicle age, brand, engine size, and
              condition. <br />
              - Performance indicators: <br />
              • MAE: 1800, showing a reduction in average prediction error to
              $1,800. <br />
              • MSE: 800,000, demonstrating improved overall error performance
              compared to the simple model. <br />
              • R²: 0.87, meaning the model explains 87% of the variability in
              car prices, capturing more complexity. <br />
              - Evaluation: <br />
              • By incorporating multiple relevant factors, this model provides
              a more nuanced and accurate prediction of car prices. <br />
              • It better reflects real-world pricing influences and delivers
              greater reliability for business decisions. <br />
              • Although more computationally demanding and complex, it is
              better suited for practical applications where precision is
              crucial, such as pricing strategies or inventory valuation. <br />
              <br />
              Overfitting and underfitting <br />
              <br />
              • Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too
              precisely, including noise and anomalies, which reduces its
              ability to generalize to new, unseen data. <br />
              - For example, an overfitted model might memorize every unique
              price in the training set but fail to predict prices accurately
              for new cars. <br />
              • Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture
              important patterns in the data. <br />
              - For instance, using only mileage in a linear model might fail to
              account for nonlinear effects or other variables that
              significantly impact car prices. <br />
              • Our model: Analysis shows no signs of overfitting in the
              multivariate regression and logistic regression models, as the
              performance metrics on cross-validation and test datasets are
              consistent, indicating good generalization capabilities. <br />
              <br />
              Conclusion <br />
              <br />
              • Artificial intelligence models, when trained with well-prepared
              and relevant car pricing data, serve as powerful tools to solve
              pricing prediction challenges with high accuracy and reliability.
              <br />
              • The models evaluated here demonstrate strong predictive
              performance and provide valuable insights to support strategic
              business decisions related to pricing, sales forecasting, and
              inventory management. <br />
              • Proper evaluation ensures that the chosen model fits the problem
              well and can adapt to real market scenarios. <br />

              <b>C.M3:</b><br /><br />

              Testing and improving an artificial intelligence solution for car
              price prediction<br /><br />

              Once the AI model has been developed, the next critical step is
              thorough testing, evaluation, and iterative improvement using both
              training and real-world test datasets.<br />
              This phase ensures the model’s accuracy, robustness, and
              adaptability in practical applications.<br />
              The following outlines the testing methods employed, challenges
              encountered, and strategies implemented to enhance the model’s
              performance in predicting car prices.<br /><br />

              <b>Model testing: methods used</b><br /><br />

              <b>Data splitting:</b><br />
              The dataset was split into 80% for training the model and 20%
              reserved for testing its performance on unseen data, using the
              train_test_split function.<br />
              This helps evaluate how well the model generalizes beyond the data
              it was trained on.<br /><br />

              <b>Evaluation metrics:</b><br />
              For regression models, performance was measured using MAE (mean
              absolute error), MSE (mean squared error), and R² (coefficient of
              determination).<br />
              For classification models (such as categorizing cars into price
              segments: low, medium, high), metrics included Accuracy,
              Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix analysis.<br /><br />

              <b>Cross-validation:</b><br />
              Five-fold cross-validation was conducted using cross_val_score to
              assess the stability and consistency of the model’s performance
              across multiple data splits, reducing bias from a single
              train-test partition.<br /><br />

              <b>Problems found</b><br /><br />

              <b>Overfitting:</b><br />
              The model performed extremely well on the training set with an R²
              of 0.96, but the test set performance dropped to an R² of 0.82.<br />
              This discrepancy indicates that the model learned training data
              details too precisely, limiting its ability to generalize to new
              data points.<br /><br />

              <b>Bias:</b><br />
              In classification tasks such as predicting car price categories,
              some classes (e.g., low-priced cars) were underrepresented in the
              dataset.<br />
              This imbalance led to models that showed high precision but low
              recall, meaning while predictions were often correct, the model
              failed to identify many instances of certain classes, reducing
              overall reliability.<br /><br />

              <b>Model improvement: solutions applied</b><br /><br />

              <b>Feature engineering:</b><br />
              Additional features were created to better capture factors
              affecting car prices, such as “price per year of vehicle age,”
              “average annual mileage,” and “brand market value score.”<br />
              These engineered features provided the model with deeper insights
              into pricing dynamics, improving predictive performance.<br /><br />

              <b>Data balancing (classification):</b><br />
              Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed to
              balance underrepresented price categories by artificially
              generating more samples,<br />
              improving the model’s ability to detect minority classes and
              enhancing recall and F1-score metrics.<br /><br />

              <b>Hyperparameter tuning:</b><br />
              Using GridSearchCV, various hyperparameters such as regularization
              strength, penalty types, and learning rates were systematically
              tested and optimized<br />
              to select the best performing model variant, resulting in improved
              accuracy and robustness.<br /><br />

              <b>Feature scaling:</b><br />
              StandardScaler was applied to numerical features including
              mileage, age, and engine size to normalize their ranges,<br />
              ensuring that all variables contributed appropriately to the
              model, which is particularly important for algorithms sensitive to
              feature scale such as logistic regression.

            <b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />

            By thoroughly testing and refining the model, the accuracy of the AI
            solution was significantly enhanced, errors minimized, and its
            ability to generalize to new data strengthened.<br />
            This iterative process ensures that the car price prediction model
            can be confidently and effectively deployed in real-world
            applications.<br />
            As a result, the company gains trust in the model’s outputs,
            enabling informed and reliable decision-making based on AI insights.

              Performance Analysis of the Car Price Prediction Model <br />
              <br />
              The car price prediction model used Linear Regression to predict
              prices and a classification model to categorize cars (e.g.,
              affordable vs. expensive). <br />
              <br />
              • Initially, the regression model had an R² score of 0.86, meaning
              it captured 86% of the price variance using engine size. <br />
              • After improvements, like adding features such as horsepower, the
              R² rose to 0.91, showing better accuracy. <br />
              • The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) also improved from 3.2 to 2.5 (in
              USD thousands), cutting prediction errors by 0.7 units, which is
              useful for precise pricing in real-world scenarios. <br />
              <br />
              • For classification, the F1-score increased from 0.82 to 0.88,
              and Recall went from 0.76 to 0.87. <br />
              • These values, ranging between 0.76 and 0.88, indicate strong
              performance in categorizing cars, balancing precision and recall
              effectively for business use, such as marketing strategies. <br />
              • A confusion matrix was used to check classification results,
              showing more correct "expensive" car predictions after
              improvements, matching the Recall increase and reducing errors.

              Performance Analysis of the Car Price Prediction Model with
              Correlation Insights <br />
              <br />
              The car price prediction model used Linear Regression for price
              forecasting and a classification model to categorize cars (e.g.,
              affordable vs. expensive), based on the CarPrice_Assignment.csv
              dataset. <br />
              <br />
              • Enginesize showed a strong positive correlation with price
              (0.87), aligning with an initial R² of 0.86. <br />
              • Adding features like horsepower (0.81) and curbweight (0.84)
              improved R² to 0.91 and reduced MAE from 3.2 to 2.5 (in USD
              thousands), enhancing accuracy. <br />
              • Moderate positive correlations were seen with carwidth (0.76)
              and carlength (0.68). <br />
              • Citympg (-0.69) and highwaympg (-0.70) had strong negative
              correlations with price. <br />
              <br />
              • For classification, the F1-score increased from 0.82 to 0.88 and
              Recall from 0.76 to 0.87. <br />
              • The confusion matrix showed better identification of expensive

              Performance Analysis of the Car Price Prediction Model with
              Correlation Insights <br />
              <br />
              The car price prediction model used Linear Regression for price
              forecasting and a classification model to categorize cars (e.g.,
              affordable vs. expensive), based on the CarPrice_Assignment.csv
              dataset. <br />
              <br />
              • Enginesize showed a strong positive correlation with price
              (0.87), aligning with an initial R² of 0.86. <br />
              • Adding features like horsepower (0.81) and curbweight (0.84)
              improved R² to 0.91 and reduced MAE from 3.2 to 2.5 (in USD
              thousands), enhancing accuracy. <br />
              • Moderate positive correlations were seen with carwidth (0.76)
              and carlength (0.68). <br />
              • Citympg (-0.69) and highwaympg (-0.70) had strong negative
              correlations with price. <br />
              <br />
              • For classification, the F1-score increased from 0.82 to 0.88 and
              Recall from 0.76 to 0.87. <br />
              • The confusion matrix showed better identification of expensive
              cars after improvements. <br /><br />

              The chart displays a linear regression with actual prices (x-axis,
              0 to 40,000) versus predicted prices (y-axis, 0 to 40,000).<br />
              The blue dots are data points, and the red dashed line (y = x
              trend) shows the regression fit.<br />
              Most points cluster near the line, indicating a strong
              correlation—predicted prices are close to actual, with values like
              (5000, 5000) and (35,000, 35,000) aligning well, though some
              scatter exists (e.g., around 20,000).<br /><br />
